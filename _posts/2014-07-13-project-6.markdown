description: This was the first WordPress site I built from the ground up - it taught me how to start mobile first and properly use media queries, thoroughly customize a bare bones starter theme, create custom post type and archive templates and integrate various plugins for sidebar management and photo galleries etc. Basically all of the WP basics which are now second nature I was acquainted with on this project.
