description: This was a fun to make one-page animated scrolling WordPress site. Each section is organized in the back end as its own page and the content is pulled into one front-page template file. Challenges included making a custom vertical slider, custom horizontally expanding bio cards, custom anchored upward expanding accordion with position detection and faux real-time blended responsive stripes using a combination of background-clip and multiple images.
