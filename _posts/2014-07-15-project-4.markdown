description: Practically everything is dynamic on this site, as the client needed to be able to easily add and modify all text and images in the WordPress admin backend. Features subtle hover transition effects and magic line navigation. Challenges included writing a custom script for organizing archived posts into accordions, and making a custom widget for the sidebar which displayed featured posts in a slideshow. Also includes Marketo form and landing page integration.
